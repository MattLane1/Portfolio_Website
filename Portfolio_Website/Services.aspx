            2004 - Present
            I started at Pyrosoft building and soldiering circuit boards. After a year
            I moved into programming, which I have done since. 
            <br />
        Eventually, I was moved to "Technical
            Sales Manager", meaning I was in charge of fixing any technical problems with
            the software, as well as providing tech-support to customers. 
            <br />
        I have also conducted trainings with the system, and have made sales calls, but my focus still remained in programming, which is my passion. I was later moved to soley 
            c++ programming, and qualtity assurance.
